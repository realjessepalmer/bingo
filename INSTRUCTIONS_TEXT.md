# Booth Bingo Instructions Text

Booth Bingo is a way for PSIFF 2026 projectionists to track festival occurrences. When things happen that you recognize from the bingo card, mark them. Or not. It's just a dumb game.

## How to Play

**Marking Items**
- Tap any cell on your theatre's bingo card when that item occurs
- The center square is always marked (it's the free space). You can even edit it if you want.
- You can unmark items if you made a mistake

**Getting a Bingo**
- Complete any row, column, or diagonal
- A dialog will appear asking you to confirm
- Once confirmed, bingos cannot be reversed!
- Confirmed bingos lock those cells and they cannot be changed

**Editing Cards**
- Click on any theatre card to edit it
- You'll get a 3-minute editing session (shown by the lock timer)
- If someone else is editing a card, you'll see it's locked
- The lock refreshes when you interact with the card

## Features

**Comments**
- Long press (or click the comment icon) any cell to add a comment
- Useful for juicy gossip
- Comments are visible to everyone viewing that card

## Notes
- No logins because it's overkill. We're going with the honor system here.
- Cards are shared across all users, so you'll see updates from other projectionists
